# vsc-pagebreaks README

Break code into pages with form feeds, then navigate between pages
showing only one page at a time.

This is my first extension. If you think it's broken, it's probably broken.

## Features

Add form feed characters (^L) to separate pages in your source code,
then use ctrl-\[ and ctrl-\] to hide everything but the current page.

Press ctrl-0 to toggle the paging behavior on and off.

## Known Issues

Toggling the single-page view always takes you to the first page,
regardless of where your cursor is.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Initial release of vsc-pagebreaks.
